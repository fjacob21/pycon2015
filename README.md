# Pycon2015
!!! Code for my special secret Pycon2015 project !!!

<b>Special secret project:</b> Create a name tag that can be activated with distance sensor and will show Pycon twitter post and my personnal info on the LCD.

I plan to use an Intel Edison with a Li-Po battery and the Adafruit ADS1015 ADC to get distance data from the Sharp2Y0A21 distance sensor. I also plan to use the Adafruit il9340c display LCD.

Normally I would have used C to do the hardware access codes but as it is Pycon I will try to only use Python!
